## 10. Credit Rules

**URL:** `/admin/credit-rules`

Configure the credit decision engine. This is where you decide who qualifies for what.

### 10.1 Score Bands

The main table is your **score bands** — the bridge from credit bureau score to loan offer.

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Band Label | e.g. "Excellent" |
| Score Range | e.g. 700–850 |
| Risk Level | Low / Medium / High / Declined |
| Max Loan | What this band qualifies for |
| Rate (p.a.) | Interest rate applied |
| Max Term | Maximum repayment term |
| Decision | Approve / Manual Review / Decline |
| 1st Loan Term | Optional restriction for first-time borrowers |
| Decline Message | Shown to client if their band declines |
| Active | Toggle |

Edit any band by clicking the pencil icon. Add new band with **+ Add Band**.

**Overlap warning** — if two bands have overlapping score ranges (e.g. 650–750 and 700–800), a red banner appears. Fix the ranges to prevent unpredictable decisions.

### 10.2 Eligibility Rules

Hard pass/fail criteria checked before bands:

- Minimum credit score
- Minimum income
- Maximum DTI (Debt-to-Income ratio)
- Minimum age
- Must be employed
- No active judgements
- Not under debt review

Toggle on/off, edit thresholds, edit decline messages.

### 10.3 Simulate

Click **Simulate** (top right, purple button) to test a decision before going live. Enter:
- Credit score
- Income
- Monthly debt
- Age
- Employed / Has Judgements / Under Debt Review / First Loan

Click **Run Simulation** to see:
- The exact decision (Approved / Manual Review / Declined)
- Which band matched
- Max loan, rate, term applied
- Every rule that failed with the reason

Use this every time you change a band or rule to make sure it behaves as expected.

## 11. SACRRA Bureau Reporting

**URL:** `/admin/sacrra`

The SACRRA module handles your monthly Layout 700v2 submission to the four credit bureaux (Experian, TransUnion, XDS, Compuscan).

### 11.1 Dashboard tab

Shows:
- Compliance Score ring — % of records currently passing all rules
- Total records ready for submission

A modal appears:

- Click **Generate**

The system:
1. Pulls every loan from the `sacrra_700_view`
2. Builds a 700-character fixed-width text file per Layout 700v2 spec
3. Creates header + data records + trailer
4. Encrypts the file with each bureau's PGP public key
5. Saves the file for download / submission

- Submission destination (email address / MOVEit folder)

Configure each bureau once at setup — the system uses these settings for every monthly submission.

### 11.5 Rejections tab

Upload rejection responses from bureaux to see what failed and why. The system parses the error messages and shows which records to fix.

![SACRRA Dashboard](screenshots/09-sacrra.png)

## 12. SACRRA Migration Validator

**URL:** `/admin/sacrra-validator`

This is the tool we use to validate an external loan book (e.g. from Zwane's old system) **before** importing it.

### 12.1 Why use this?

When you bring loans across from another lending system, the data needs to pass SACRRA Layout 700v2 rules before it can be reported to bureaux. This tool checks every record up front.

### 12.2 How to use it

**Step 1: Upload Loan Book**

Click the upload area and select a CSV file. The system auto-detects the header row.

**Step 2: Column Mapping**

The system tries to **auto-map** Zwane's column names to our SACRRA fields. Required fields are shown in bold. Adjust any incorrect mappings using the drop-downs.

Required fields:
- SA ID Number
- Surname, First Names
- Address
- Account Number
- Opening Balance, Current Balance
- Date Opened, Term (Months)

Optional fields (recommended):
- DOB, Gender, Mobile, Postal Code
- Status Code, Installment, Months in Arrears

Click **Validate Records**.

**Step 3: Results**

Four cards at the top:
- Total Records
- Valid count (green)
- Errors count (red)
- Compliance % (orange — the headline metric)

Tab filter: All / Failed Only / Passed Only

Table shows every record with:
- Row number
- SA ID
- Name
- Balance
- Status
- Issues (red list of every failed rule per record)

**Step 4: Download**

- **Errors CSV** — send back to Zwane to fix
- **Valid CSV** — cleaned, column-normalised, ready for import

### 12.3 What gets checked

- SA ID must be 13 digits with valid Luhn checksum
- DOB must match SA ID digits 1–6
- Gender must match SA ID digit 11 (0–4 = Female, 5–9 = Male)
- All required fields populated
- Balances ≥ 0, within N9 limit (max R999,999,999)
- Dates valid YYYYMMDD, opened date in past
- Status codes valid (C/P/D/T/V/L)
- Months in arrears consistent with status (e.g. status C cannot have arrears)
- Mobile in valid SA format
- Postal code 4 digits

## 16. Troubleshooting

### Login fails
- Check email and password
- Use "Forgot password" to reset
- Confirm you have an active account — ask the Super Admin

### Pages slow to load
- Refresh the page
- Check internet connection
- Try again in a few minutes

### Can't see a client / application
- Check your branch filter — you might only have access to your branch's data
- Check the status filter — old or archived items may be hidden

### Client can't see banking details on the EFT screen
- **Settings** → **System Branding** → **Company Banking Details** — ensure all fields are filled in

### SMS notifications not sending
- Check **System Status** indicator on Dashboard
- Contact your platform administrator

### A disbursement marked as paid but no client SMS
- Check the client's `cell_tel_no` field on their profile — must be valid SA format
- Check SMS provider quota with platform administrator

### Cash Ledger doesn't reflect a payment
- Confirm the payment was set to "Confirmed" — pending entries don't update balances
- Check the date filter on the Cash Ledger

### SACRRA file generated but no records
- Check the `sacrra_700_view` — only loans with eligible statuses appear
- Check date filter on the SACRRA page

### Credit score not updating
- Check **Settings** that EXPERIAN_USERNAME and EXPERIAN_PASSWORD are set
- Confirm the client's ID number is correct
- View the credit check error log on the application detail page
